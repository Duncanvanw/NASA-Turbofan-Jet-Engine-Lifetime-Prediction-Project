# NASA-Turbofan-Jet-Engine-Lifetime-Prediction-Project
This repository contains the code used for the NASA Turbofan Jet Engine Lifetime Prediction Assignment for Maintenance Modelling Analysis.

In the xAI CCMAPS.ipynb the notebook can be found where the analysis is made of the dataset (contained in les05_CMAPSStrain001.txt) and the remaining useful lifetime (RUL_FD001.csv), the names of the datasets have been kept the same as given in the lesson for educational purposes. In the notebook the data is loaded in, and preprocessed for the training of the machine learning models on the data. The predictions are made and the models have multiple evaluatory functions that can be experimented with. For more information and results on the model, see the pdf in te repository.
